Hello! I am a web developer, UI designer, and graphic designer.

I specialize in front-end, mainly Astro and React. I use Tailwind, GSAP, and Framer Motion.

I also like to experiment with other technologies, such as operating system architecture, Rust, bot development, and app development.

I always use Figma to create a website/app design first, then I code it.
